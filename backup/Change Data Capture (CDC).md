System design interviews often delve into the complexities of data synchronization and real-time data processing. One crucial technique that frequently surfaces is Change Data Capture (CDC). Understanding CDC is essential for designing robust and scalable systems. This post will introduce you to the core concepts of CDC and its importance in system design.

# What is Change Data Capture (CDC)?

Change Data Capture is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track data that has changed in a database so that action can be taken using the changed data. It's about efficiently capturing and propagating changes made to data in a source system (usually a database) to downstream systems in near real-time. This is crucial for various use cases, including: Â  

- Keeping search indexes up-to-date (e.g., Elasticsearch, Solr): Ensuring search results reflect the latest data.
- Data warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Populating data warehouses with incremental changes.
- Real-time analytics and dashboards: Providing up-to-the-minute insights.
- Cache invalidation: Keeping caches consistent with the source data.
- Auditing and compliance: Tracking data changes for regulatory purposes.

# Why is CDC Important in System Design?

Traditional methods of data synchronization, like batch processing or polling, can be inefficient and introduce significant latency. 

CDC offers several advantages:

- Near Real-Time Updates: CDC captures changes as they happen, enabling near real-time data synchronization.
- Reduced Database Load: Instead of constantly querying the database for changes, CDC reads change logs or uses other efficient mechanisms, minimizing the impact on database performance.
- Data Integrity: CDC ensures that changes are captured accurately and in order, maintaining data consistency across different systems.
- Decoupling: CDC decouples the source system from downstream systems, improving flexibility and scalability.

# Common CDC Techniques:

There are several ways to implement CDC, each with its own trade-offs:

- Database Logs (Log-Based CDC): This is the most efficient and preferred method. Databases maintain transaction logs (e.g., redo logs in Oracle, write-ahead logs (WAL) in PostgreSQL, binary logs in MySQL) that record every change made to the database. CDC tools can parse these logs and extract the change data.

Pros: Minimal impact on database performance, high throughput, reliable.
Cons: Requires access to database logs, can be complex to implement directly.

- Triggers: Database triggers can be used to capture changes. A trigger is a stored procedure that automatically executes in response to certain events (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

Pros: Relatively simple to implement.
Cons: Can add overhead to database operations, can be difficult to manage complex change capture logic, not suitable for high-volume changes.

- Polling: This involves periodically querying the database for changes based on a timestamp column or a modified flag.

Pros: Simple to implement.
Cons: Inefficient, introduces latency, puts significant load on the database, can miss changes if the polling interval is too long.

- Dual Writes: This involves writing data to both the database and the downstream system simultaneously.

Pros: Simple for basic use cases
Cons: Introduces tight coupling, difficult to ensure atomicity, prone to inconsistencies if one write fails.

# Example Scenario: Keeping Elasticsearch Synchronized

Imagine a system with a relational database storing product information and Elasticsearch used for search. Using CDC, you would:

- Use a tool like Debezium to capture changes from the database's transaction log.
- Stream these changes through a message queue like Kafka.
- Have a consumer application read from Kafka, transform the change data into a format suitable for Elasticsearch, and index it.

This ensures that Elasticsearch is always up-to-date with the latest product information without constantly querying the database.

Understanding CDC is a valuable asset in system design interviews. It demonstrates your knowledge of data synchronization techniques and your ability to design efficient and scalable systems. By understanding the different methods and their trade-offs, you can effectively address related questions and showcase your expertise.
