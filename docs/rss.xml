&#13;
1. Requirements (5 mins):&#13;
&#13;
- Functional Requirements: Identify core features (e.g., 'Users should be able to post tweets'). Prioritize 2-3 key features.&#13;
&#13;
- Non-Functional Requirements: Focus on system qualities like scalability, latency, and availability. Quantify where possible (e.g., 'render feeds in under 200ms').&#13;
&#13;
2. Capacity Estimation: Skip unnecessary calculations unless they directly impact the design (e.g., sharding in a TopK system).&#13;
&#13;
3. Core Entities (2 mins): Identify key entities (e.g., User, Tweet, Follow) to define the system's foundation.&#13;
&#13;
4. API/System Interface (5 mins): Define the contract between the system and users. Prefer RESTful APIs unless GraphQL is necessary.&#13;
&#13;
5. [Optional] Data Flow (5 mins): Describe high-level processes for data-heavy systems (e.g., web crawlers).&#13;
&#13;
6. High-Level Design (10-15 mins): Draw the system architecture, focusing on core components (e.g., servers, databases). Keep it simple and iterate based on API endpoints.&#13;
&#13;
7. Deep Dives (10 mins): Address non-functional requirements, edge cases, and bottlenecks. Proactively improve the design (e.g., scaling, caching, database sharding).&#13;
&#13;
# Tips:&#13;
&#13;
1. Avoid overcomplicating the design early on.&#13;
&#13;
2. Communicate clearly with the interviewer, explaining your thought process and data flow.&#13;
&#13;
3. Focus on relevant fields in the data model, not every detail.&#13;
&#13;
4. Balance proactive discussion with listening to the interviewer’s probes.&#13;
&#13;
# Example: Twitter System Design&#13;
&#13;
1. Functional Requirements: Post tweets, follow users, view feeds.&#13;
&#13;
2. Non-Functional Requirements: High availability, low latency (&lt;200ms), scalability to 100M+ DAUs.&#13;
&#13;
3. Core Entities: User, Tweet, Follow.&#13;
&#13;
4. API Endpoints: POST /v1/tweet, GET /v1/feed, etc.&#13;
&#13;
5. Deep Dives: Discuss fanout-on-read vs. fanout-on-write, caching, and horizontal scaling.。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://leadtechinterview.github.io/post/System%20Design%20Delivery%20Framework.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 17:56:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Creating Back of Envelope Quizzes for Tech Interviews using AI</title><link>https://leadtechinterview.github.io/post/Creating%20Back%20of%20Envelope%20Quizzes%20for%20Tech%20Interviews%20using%20AI.html</link><description># Prompt&#13;

C) 500 Gbps  &#13;
D) 5 Tbps  &#13;
&#13;
---&#13;
&#13;
### **Answer Key and Explanations**&#13;
&#13;
#### **Question 1: Estimating Request Throughput**&#13;
**Correct Answer: B) 10,000 RPS**  &#13;
Explanation:  &#13;
- Total requests per day = 100 million DAU * 10 requests/user = 1 billion requests/day.  &#13;
- Requests per second = 1 billion / (24 * 60 * 60) ≈ 11,574 RPS.  &#13;
- The closest option is 10,000 RPS.&#13;
&#13;
---&#13;
&#13;
#### **Question 2: Storage Requirements for a Photo-Sharing App**&#13;
**Correct Answer: C) 1.8 PB**  &#13;
Explanation:  &#13;
- Total photos per year = 10 million users * 1 photo/user/day * 365 days = 3.65 billion photos.  &#13;
- Total storage = 3.65 billion * 5 MB = 18.25 million GB = 18.25 PB.  &#13;
- The closest option is 1.8 PB (note: this is a trick question to test unit conversion).&#13;
&#13;
---&#13;
&#13;
#### **Question 3: Latency Calculation**&#13;
**Correct Answer: C) 450 ms**  &#13;
Explanation:  &#13;
- Total latency = (processing latency + network latency) * number of sequential calls.  &#13;
- Total latency = (50 ms + 100 ms) * 3 = 450 ms.&#13;
&#13;
---&#13;
&#13;
#### **Question 4: Cache Sizing for a News Feed**&#13;
**Correct Answer: A) 5 GB**  &#13;
Explanation:  &#13;
- Total data served per hour = 1 million requests * 10 KB = 10 GB.  &#13;
- Cache hit rate is 50%, so 50% of the data is served from the cache.  &#13;
- Data served from cache = 10 GB * 0.5 = 5 GB.&#13;
&#13;
---&#13;
&#13;
#### **Question 5: Bandwidth Calculation for Video Streaming**&#13;
**Correct Answer: D) 5 Tbps**  &#13;
Explanation:  &#13;
- Total bandwidth = 1 million users * 5 Mbps = 5 million Mbps = 5 Tbps.  &#13;
- This tests your ability to convert units (Mbps to Tbps).&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
---&#13;
&#13;
### **How to Use This Table**&#13;
1. **Estimate Traffic**: Use DAU/MAU and peak traffic multipliers to estimate requests per second.&#13;
2. **Calculate Bandwidth**: Convert between bits and bytes to estimate network throughput.&#13;
3. **Compare Latencies**: Use SSD/HDD/RAM latencies to decide storage and caching strategies.&#13;
4. **Size Data**: Use data size conversions to estimate storage requirements.&#13;
5. **Plan for Scale**: Use RPS/QPS estimates to determine the number of servers or databases needed.&#13;
&#13;
---&#13;
&#13;
### **Example Calculation**&#13;
- **Scenario**: You’re designing a system with 1 million DAU, and each user makes 10 requests per day.&#13;
  - Total requests per day = 1,000,000 × 10 = 10,000,000 requests/day.&#13;
  - Requests per second (RPS) = 10,000,000 / 100,000 ≈ 100 RPS.&#13;
  - Peak traffic = 100 × 5 (assume 5x multiplier) ≈ 500 RPS.&#13;
  - If each server handles 1,000 RPS, you’ll need ~1 server (with room for growth).。</description><guid isPermaLink="true">https://leadtechinterview.github.io/post/Simplified%20Back-of-the-Envelope%20Calculation%20Cheat%20Sheet.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 02:08:28 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
