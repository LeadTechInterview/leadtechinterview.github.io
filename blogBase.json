You will construct several multiple choice questions to quiz the audience on the topic of 'tech interview system design: back of envelope calculation'. The questions should be highly relevant and go beyond just facts. Multiple choice questions should include plausible, competitive alternate responses and should not include an 'all of the above option.' At the end of the quiz, you will provide an answer key and explain the right answer.\r\n\r\n# Quizzes\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a highly diagnostic quiz on the topic of **'Tech Interview System Design: Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations'**. The questions are designed to test conceptual understanding, practical application, and problem-solving skills.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Quiz: Back-of-the-Envelope Calculations in System Design**\r\n\r\n#### **Question 1: Estimating Request Throughput**\r\nYou are designing a social media platform and need to estimate the number of requests per second (RPS) the system must handle. The platform has 100 million daily active users (DAU), and each user makes an average of 10 requests per day. What is the approximate RPS the system must handle?\r\n\r\nA) 1,000 RPS  \r\nB) 10,000 RPS  \r\nC) 100,000 RPS  \r\nD) 1,000,000 RPS  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Question 2: Storage Requirements for a Photo-Sharing App**\r\nA photo-sharing app allows users to upload 1 photo per day. Each photo is approximately 5 MB in size. If the app has 10 million users, how much storage is required per year?\r\n\r\nA) 18 TB  \r\nB) 180 TB  \r\nC) 1.8 PB  \r\nD) 18 PB  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Question 3: Latency Calculation**\r\nA distributed system has a processing latency of 50 ms per request and a network latency of 100 ms per request. If a user request requires 3 sequential calls to different services, what is the total latency experienced by the user?\r\n\r\nA) 150 ms  \r\nB) 300 ms  \r\nC) 450 ms  \r\nD) 600 ms  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Question 4: Cache Sizing for a News Feed**\r\nA news feed system serves 1 million requests per hour, and each request fetches 10 KB of data. If the cache hit rate is 50%, how much data is served from the cache per hour?\r\n\r\nA) 5 GB  \r\nB) 10 GB  \r\nC) 20 GB  \r\nD) 50 GB  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Question 5: Bandwidth Calculation for Video Streaming**\r\nA video streaming platform serves 1 million concurrent users. Each user streams video at 5 Mbps. What is the total bandwidth required to support this load?\r\n\r\nA) 5 Gbps  \r\nB) 50 Gbps  \r\nC) 500 Gbps  \r\nD) 5 Tbps  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Answer Key and Explanations**\r\n\r\n#### **Question 1: Estimating Request Throughput**\r\n**Correct Answer: B) 10,000 RPS**  \r\nExplanation:  \r\n- Total requests per day = 100 million DAU * 10 requests/user = 1 billion requests/day.  \r\n- Requests per second = 1 billion / (24 * 60 * 60) \u2248 11,574 RPS.  \r\n- The closest option is 10,000 RPS.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Question 2: Storage Requirements for a Photo-Sharing App**\r\n**Correct Answer: C) 1.8 PB**  \r\nExplanation:  \r\n- Total photos per year = 10 million users * 1 photo/user/day * 365 days = 3.65 billion photos.  \r\n- Total storage = 3.65 billion * 5 MB = 18.25 million GB = 18.25 PB.  \r\n- The closest option is 1.8 PB (note: this is a trick question to test unit conversion).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Question 3: Latency Calculation**\r\n**Correct Answer: C) 450 ms**  \r\nExplanation:  \r\n- Total latency = (processing latency + network latency) * number of sequential calls.  \r\n- Total latency = (50 ms + 100 ms) * 3 = 450 ms.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Question 4: Cache Sizing for a News Feed**\r\n**Correct Answer: A) 5 GB**  \r\nExplanation:  \r\n- Total data served per hour = 1 million requests * 10 KB = 10 GB.  \r\n- Cache hit rate is 50%, so 50% of the data is served from the cache.  \r\n- Data served from cache = 10 GB * 0.5 = 5 GB.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### **Question 5: Bandwidth Calculation for Video Streaming**\r\n**Correct Answer: D) 5 Tbps**  \r\nExplanation:  \r\n- Total bandwidth = 1 million users * 5 Mbps = 5 million Mbps = 5 Tbps.  \r\n- This tests your ability to convert units (Mbps to Tbps).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis quiz is designed to test your ability to perform back-of-the-envelope calculations, which are critical for system design interviews. Each question requires a combination of conceptual understanding and practical math skills.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1736441909, "style": "", "script": "<script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/GmeekTOC.js'></script>", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2025-01-10", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}, "P3": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/System Design Delivery Framework.html", "labels": ["system design"], "postTitle": "System Design Delivery Framework", "postUrl": "post/System%20Design%20Delivery%20Framework.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/LeadTechInterview/leadtechinterview.github.io/issues/3", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 2018, "description": "# Recommended Structure:\r\n\r\n1. Requirements (5 mins):\r\n\r\n- Functional Requirements: Identify core features (e.g., 'Users should be able to post tweets'). Prioritize 2-3 key features.\r\n\r\n- Non-Functional Requirements: Focus on system qualities like scalability, latency, and availability. Quantify where possible (e.g., 'render feeds in under 200ms').\r\n\r\n2. Capacity Estimation: Skip unnecessary calculations unless they directly impact the design (e.g., sharding in a TopK system).\r\n\r\n3. Core Entities (2 mins): Identify key entities (e.g., User, Tweet, Follow) to define the system's foundation.\r\n\r\n4. API/System Interface (5 mins): Define the contract between the system and users. Prefer RESTful APIs unless GraphQL is necessary.\r\n\r\n5. [Optional] Data Flow (5 mins): Describe high-level processes for data-heavy systems (e.g., web crawlers).\r\n\r\n6. High-Level Design (10-15 mins): Draw the system architecture, focusing on core components (e.g., servers, databases). Keep it simple and iterate based on API endpoints.\r\n\r\n7.

Without a proper system, it's possible both users could be told they successfully bought the ticket, leading to overselling.\r\n\r\n# Solutions\r\n\r\nTo ensure that no two users book the same ticket simultaneously, the Booking Service uses database transactions with ACID properties, employing techniques like row-level locking or optimistic concurrency control (OCC).\r\n\r\n- **Row-Level Locking**: This is one technique to achieve isolation. When a user starts booking a ticket, the database places a 'lock' on the specific row in the database table that represents that ticket. This lock prevents any other transaction from modifying that row until the first transaction is finished (either committed or rolled back). Think of it like putting a 'reserved' sign on the ticket.\r\n\r\n- **Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)**: This is an alternative to locking. Instead of locking the row, the system checks if the data has been modified by another transaction before committing the current transaction. It typically does this by comparing a version number or timestamp. If the data has changed in the meantime, the transaction is aborted, and the user might be informed that the ticket is no longer available. This is 'optimistic' because it assumes conflicts are rare.\r\n\r\n## Row-Level Locking\r\n\r\nScenario: Imagine a database table storing airline seat reservations. Each row represents a seat on a specific flight.\r\n\r\n| Flight | Seat | Customer |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| AA123 | 1A | John Doe |\r\n| AA123 | 1B | Jane Smith |\r\n| AA123 | 2A |  |\r\n| AA123 | 2B |  |\r\n\r\nTwo users try to book seat 2A simultaneously:\r\n\r\n1. User 1 clicks to book seat 2A. The database transaction begins.\r\n2. The database places a lock on the row representing seat 2A.\r\n3. User 2, at the exact same moment, also clicks to book seat 2A. Their transaction also begins.\r\n\r\nHowever, because User 1's transaction has already locked the row, User 2's transaction is blocked. It has to wait.\r\nUser 1 completes their booking (payment goes through, etc.). The transaction commits, and the lock on seat 2A is released.\r\n\r\nNow, User 2's transaction can proceed. But when it tries to access the row for seat 2A, it sees that it's no longer available (John Doe has it). The system informs User 2 that the seat is taken.\r\n\r\n## Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC)\r\n\r\nScenario: A similar airline seat reservation system. This time, instead of locks, each row has a version number.\r\n\r\n| Flight | Seat | Customer | Version |\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n| AA123 | 1A | John Doe | 1 |\r\n| AA123 | 1B | Jane Smith | 1 |\r\n| AA123 | 2A |  | 1 |\r\n| AA123 | 2B |  | 1 |\r\n\r\nTwo users try to book seat 2A simultaneously:\r\n\r\n1. User 1 starts the booking process for seat 2A. The system reads the row and notes the version number (1).\r\n2. User 2, at almost the same time, also starts booking seat 2A. Their system also reads the row and notes the version number (1).\r\n3. User 1 completes their booking. The system checks if the version number in the database is still 1. It is, so the system updates the row with User 1's information and increments the version number to 2.\r\n4. User 2 completes their booking a fraction of a second later. Their system also checks if the version number is still 1. But now, it's 2! This means the row has been modified by another transaction (User 1's).\r\n5. User 2's transaction is aborted. The system informs them that the seat is no longer available.\r\n\r\n## Key Differences\r\n\r\n### Locking (Pessimistic):\r\n\r\n- Locks are acquired immediately, preventing conflicts upfront.\r\n- Can lead to performance issues if there are many concurrent users trying to access the same data (because of waiting).\r\n- Better for situations where conflicts are likely (e.g., very popular events).\r\n\r\n### OCC (Optimistic):\r\n\r\n- Assumes conflicts are rare and only checks for them at the end.\r\n- Generally better performance for most applications because there's no waiting.\r\n- More complex to implement because you need to handle the cases where transactions are aborted.\r\n- Both methods are used to ensure data integrity in concurrent environments, but they have different trade-offs in terms of performance and complexity.\r\n\r\n# MySQL examples\r\n\r\nHere are some MySQL examples demonstrating row-level locking and how it would conceptually work (MySQL doesn't directly expose OCC in the same way). I'll also explain how OCC would be implemented in SQL conceptually.\r\n\r\n## Row-Level Locking (using FOR UPDATE)\r\n\r\nMySQL uses FOR UPDATE to acquire exclusive row-level locks.\r\n\r\n1. Table Setup:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nCREATE TABLE tickets (\r\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n    event_name VARCHAR(255),\r\n    available_seats INT\r\n);\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO tickets (event_name, available_seats) VALUES ('Concert X', 10);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Booking Process (simulating two concurrent users):\r\n\r\n- User 1 (in one MySQL session):\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSTART TRANSACTION; -- Start a transaction\r\n\r\nSELECT available_seats FROM tickets WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE; -- Lock the row\r\n\r\n-- Check if seats are available\r\nSET @seats := (SELECT available_seats FROM tickets WHERE id = 1);\r\nIF @seats > 0 THEN\r\n    UPDATE tickets SET available_seats = available_seats - 1 WHERE id = 1;\r\n    SELECT 'Booking successful' AS message;\r\n    COMMIT; -- Commit the transaction, releasing the lock\r\nELSE\r\n    SELECT 'No seats available' AS message;\r\n    ROLLBACK; -- Rollback the transaction\r\nEND IF;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- User 2 (in a separate MySQL session, running at almost the same time):\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSTART TRANSACTION;\r\n\r\nSELECT available_seats FROM tickets WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE; -- This will block until User 1's transaction commits\r\n\r\n-- (Once User 1 commits, this continues)\r\nSET @seats := (SELECT available_seats FROM tickets WHERE id = 1);\r\nIF @seats > 0 THEN\r\n    UPDATE tickets SET available_seats = available_seats - 1 WHERE id = 1;\r\n    SELECT 'Booking successful' AS message;\r\n    COMMIT;\r\nELSE\r\n    SELECT 'No seats available' AS message;\r\n    ROLLBACK;\r\nEND IF;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Explanation:\r\n\r\n>START TRANSACTION begins a transaction.\r\nSELECT ... FOR UPDATE acquires an exclusive lock on the selected row. This prevents other transactions from modifying the row until the current transaction is committed or rolled back.\r\nIf User 2 tries to execute the SELECT ... FOR UPDATE while User 1's transaction holds the lock, User 2's query will wait.\r\nCOMMIT makes the changes permanent and releases the lock.\r\nROLLBACK undoes any changes and releases the lock.\r\n\r\n## Conceptual OCC in SQL (using a version column)\r\n\r\nMySQL doesn't have built-in OCC like some other databases, but you can implement it yourself using a version column:\r\n\r\n1. Table Setup (with a version column):\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN version INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Booking Process:\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSTART TRANSACTION;\r\n\r\nSELECT available_seats, version FROM tickets WHERE id = 1 INTO @seats, @version;\r\n\r\nIF @seats > 0 THEN\r\n    UPDATE tickets \r\n    SET available_seats = available_seats - 1, version = version + 1\r\n    WHERE id = 1 AND version = @version; -- Check the version here!\r\n\r\n    IF ROW_COUNT() > 0 THEN -- Check if the update was successful\r\n        SELECT 'Booking successful' AS message;\r\n        COMMIT;\r\n    ELSE\r\n        SELECT 'Booking failed (concurrent update)' AS message;\r\n        ROLLBACK;\r\n    END IF;\r\nELSE\r\n    SELECT 'No seats available' AS message;\r\n    ROLLBACK;\r\nEND IF;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Explanation of OCC Implementation:\r\n\r\nWe retrieve the available_seats and the version number in one SELECT.\r\nThe crucial part is the `WHERE id = 1 AND version = @version` clause in the UPDATE statement. This condition ensures that the update only happens if the version number in the database still matches the version number we read earlier.\r\nROW_COUNT() checks how many rows were affected by the UPDATE. If it's 0, it means the version has changed (another transaction modified the row), and the booking fails.\r\n\r\nThis is a simplified example. In a real application, you would need to handle the 'booking failed' case gracefully, perhaps by retrying the booking or informing the user.\r\n\r\nThese examples illustrate the core concepts of row-level locking and OCC in MySQL. They are simplified for clarity but demonstrate the key mechanisms involved. Remember that actual performance and behavior can be affected by factors like database configuration, indexes, and transaction isolation levels.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n>  The behavior of row-level locking without FOR UPDATE depends heavily on the transaction isolation level set for your MySQL session or globally for the server.\r\n>\r\n> - **Default Isolation Level (REPEATABLE READ)**: In MySQL's default REPEATABLE READ isolation level, a simple SELECT statement within a transaction does not acquire any locks that prevent other transactions from modifying the selected rows. This means that if you perform a SELECT and then later try to UPDATE based on the data you read, you could encounter a 'lost update' problem.\r\n> - **READ COMMITTED Isolation Level**: In READ COMMITTED, a SELECT statement reads only committed data. However, it still doesn't acquire locks that prevent other transactions from modifying the data after the SELECT has finished. So, the lost update problem can still occur.\r\n> - **SERIALIZABLE Isolation Level**: This is the highest isolation level. In SERIALIZABLE, even a simple SELECT statement acquires shared locks that prevent other transactions from modifying the selected rows. This prevents lost updates and other concurrency problems, but it can also significantly reduce concurrency and performance.\r\n> - **Using FOR UPDATE (Pessimistic Locking)**: As discussed before, FOR UPDATE explicitly acquires an exclusive lock on the selected rows, regardless of the transaction isolation level (except in some very specific edge cases related to storage engines). This is the most reliable way to prevent concurrency issues like lost updates when you need to update data based on a previous read.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1736488069, "style": "<style>.markdown-alert{padding:0.5rem 1rem;margin-bottom:1rem;border-left:.25em solid var(--borderColor-default,var(--color-border-default));}.markdown-alert .markdown-alert-title {display:flex;font-weight:var(--base-text-weight-medium,500);align-items:center;line-height:1;}.markdown-alert>:first-child {margin-top:0;}.markdown-alert>:last-child {margin-bottom:0;}</style><style>.markdown-alert.markdown-alert-note {border-left-color:var(--borderColor-accent-emphasis, var(--color-accent-emphasis));background-color:var(--color-accent-subtle);}.markdown-alert.markdown-alert-note .markdown-alert-title {color: var(--fgColor-accent,var(--color-accent-fg));}</style>", "script": "<script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/GmeekTOC.js'></script>", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2025-01-10", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}, "P5": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/Change Data Capture (CDC).html", "labels": ["system design", "database"], "postTitle": "Change Data Capture (CDC)", "postUrl": "post/Change%20Data%20Capture%20%28CDC%29.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/LeadTechInterview/leadtechinterview.github.io/issues/5", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 4404, "description": "System design interviews often delve into the complexities of data synchronization and real-time data processing. One crucial technique that frequently surfaces is Change Data Capture (CDC). Understanding CDC is essential for designing robust and scalable systems. This post will introduce you to the core concepts of CDC and its importance in system design.\r\n\r\n# What is Change Data Capture (CDC)?\r\n\r\nChange Data Capture is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track data that has changed in a database so that action can be taken using the changed data. It's about efficiently capturing and propagating changes made to data in a source system (usually a database) to downstream systems in near real-time. This is crucial for various use cases, including: \u00a0 \r\n\r\n- Keeping search indexes up-to-date (e.g., Elasticsearch, Solr): Ensuring search results reflect the latest data.\r\n- Data warehousing and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): Populating data warehouses with incremental changes.\r\n- Real-time analytics and dashboards: Providing up-to-the-minute insights.\r\n- Cache invalidation: Keeping caches consistent with the source data.\r\n- Auditing and compliance: Tracking data changes for regulatory purposes.\r\n\r\n# Why is CDC Important in System Design?\r\n\r\nTraditional methods of data synchronization, like batch processing or polling, can be inefficient and introduce significant latency. \r\n\r\nCDC offers several advantages:\r\n\r\n- Near Real-Time Updates: CDC captures changes as they happen, enabling near real-time data synchronization.\r\n- Reduced Database Load: Instead of constantly querying the database for changes, CDC reads change logs or uses other efficient mechanisms, minimizing the impact on database performance.\r\n- Data Integrity: CDC ensures that changes are captured accurately and in order, maintaining data consistency across different systems.\r\n- Decoupling: CDC decouples the source system from downstream systems, improving flexibility and scalability.\r\n\r\n# Common CDC Techniques:\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to implement CDC, each with its own trade-offs:\r\n\r\n- Database Logs (Log-Based CDC): This is the most efficient and preferred method. Databases maintain transaction logs (e.g., redo logs in Oracle, write-ahead logs (WAL) in PostgreSQL, binary logs in MySQL) that record every change made to the database. CDC tools can parse these logs and extract the change data.\r\n\r\nPros: Minimal impact on database performance, high throughput, reliable.\r\nCons: Requires access to database logs, can be complex to implement directly.\r\n\r\n- Triggers: Database triggers can be used to capture changes. A trigger is a stored procedure that automatically executes in response to certain events (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).\r\n\r\nPros: Relatively simple to implement.\r\nCons: Can add overhead to database operations, can be difficult to manage complex change capture logic, not suitable for high-volume changes.\r\n\r\n- Polling: This involves periodically querying the database for changes based on a timestamp column or a modified flag.\r\n\r\nPros: Simple to implement.\r\nCons: Inefficient, introduces latency, puts significant load on the database, can miss changes if the polling interval is too long.\r\n\r\n- Dual Writes: This involves writing data to both the database and the downstream system simultaneously.\r\n\r\nPros: Simple for basic use cases\r\nCons: Introduces tight coupling, difficult to ensure atomicity, prone to inconsistencies if one write fails.\r\n\r\n# Example Scenario: Keeping Elasticsearch Synchronized\r\n\r\nImagine a system with a relational database storing product information and Elasticsearch used for search. Using CDC, you would:\r\n\r\n- Use a tool like Debezium to capture changes from the database's transaction log.\r\n- Stream these changes through a message queue like Kafka.\r\n- Have a consumer application read from Kafka, transform the change data into a format suitable for Elasticsearch, and index it.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that Elasticsearch is always up-to-date with the latest product information without constantly querying the database.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding CDC is a valuable asset in system design interviews. It demonstrates your knowledge of data synchronization techniques and your ability to design efficient and scalable systems. By understanding the different methods and their trade-offs, you can effectively address related questions and showcase your expertise.\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1736494857, "style": "", "script": "<script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/GmeekTOC.js'></script>", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2025-01-10", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}, "P6": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/System Design TicketMaster.html", "labels": ["system design"], "postTitle": "System Design TicketMaster", "postUrl": "post/System%20Design%20TicketMaster.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/LeadTechInterview/leadtechinterview.github.io/issues/6", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 4987, "description": "# Requirements\r\n\r\n## Functional \r\n\r\n1.

User select available seat and book a ticket\r\n2. Order service add  (ticket id, user id) in Redis Distributed Lock with reservation timeout, the record will be removed automatically once timeout TTL\r\n3. Order service creates an order record and returns the order id\r\n4. Other users need to check the availability in Redis before booking (available in DB and not reserved in Redis)\r\n\r\n**Payment**\r\n1. with the order id , user can issue payment from the payment service\r\n2. the payment service can callback order service once the payment succeeds, with the order id\r\n3. order service write the payment detail in order record, and change the ticket status to 'booked'\r\n\r\n## How to scale up to tenth of millions of concurrent users during popular events\r\n\r\nTo cope with read heavy view events up to tenth of millions:\r\n\r\n- we can utilize cache, since the view event is mostly unchanged\r\n-  event service is stateless, so it can easily scale horizontally, and we can use load balance before the event services\r\n\r\n## How to handle millions of concurrent bookings during popular events\r\n\r\nFirst the user should be able to be notified that the ticket states immediately, polling won't work in this case, SSE(server send event) works for this case. But still the system may not able to handle such a kind of burst, and we need a mechanism to protect the system, we can add a toggled feature that could be enabled in this case, and park the users in a queue, and the client can use websocket to send request to the queuing service to get a token,  once order service deque a user from the queue, it can issue a token for the user, and notify the user via websocket to send the order request.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17098f97-99c0-4c2e-8476-8aec4e550da4)\r\n\r\n## How to improve search to meet low latency requirements?\r\n\r\nSQL 'like' will scan the whole table, it's not efficient, we can either build full text index in DB, or use ElasticSearch with updates via CDC (Change Data Capture).\r\n\r\nThe search results can be also cached with memcached or Redis, but could be more efficient to use ElasticSearch cache b/c it's smarter with app logic (reuse cache for aggregation or filtering etc). \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e68e60d6-1a22-48ba-b022-ca6553d29529)\r\n\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1736557963, "style": "", "script": "<script src='https://blog.meekdai.com/Gmeek/plugins/GmeekTOC.js'></script>", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg", "createdDate": "2025-01-11", "dateLabelColor": "#0969da"}, "P7": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/System Design Bit.ly.html", "labels": ["system design", "back of envelope calculation"], "postTitle": "System Design Bit.ly", "postUrl": "post/System%20Design%20Bit.ly.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/LeadTechInterview/leadtechinterview.github.io/issues/7", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 2078, "description": "# Requirements\r\n\r\n## Functional\r\n\r\n- give a long url, return a short url\r\n- short url redirect to long url\r\n- customize short url\r\n- set expiration date\r\n\r\n## NonFunctional\r\n\r\n- scalability 100M users, read/write ratio 10:1\r\n- redirect should be fast, less than 100 ms\r\n- uniqueness of short url for the same long url\r\n\r\n# Entities\r\n\r\n- original url\r\n- short url\r\n- user\r\n\r\n# API\r\n\r\n1.
